# Environment Setup

## Required Environment Variables

Set the following environment variables before using MSB:

```bash
# Required for OpenAI models
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-api-key"

# Required for Anthropic models  
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-anthropic-api-key"

# Required for Cohere models
export COHERE_API_KEY="your-cohere-api-key"
```

## Using .env File

You can also create a `.env` file in the project root:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-anthropic-api-key
COHERE_API_KEY=your-cohere-api-key
```

Then load it using python-dotenv:

```python
from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv()
```

## API Key Security

- Never commit API keys to version control
- Use environment variables or secure key management systems
- Rotate keys regularly
- Use different keys for development and production
